# Portfolio — Le Minh

This is a lightweight, responsive portfolio website scaffold. It includes a hero, projects, skills, and contact sections with modern CSS and a small JS helper.

How to preview locally (PowerShell):

1. Open PowerShell in this folder (your repo root).
2. Run a simple static server using Python:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or use VS Code Live Server extension and open `index.html`.

Next steps you might want me to do:
- Replace placeholder images with real screenshots
- Add project detail pages or an expanded modal
- Hook up a real contact backend (Formspree, Netlify Functions, or custom API)
- Add SEO/meta images and structured data
